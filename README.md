run-generator
=============

The following is a web application I made for the Tufts University XC team that displays runs on campus.

It allows the user to input their starting location (one of two locations on campus), the preferred run distance, and their flexibility in miles, and it returns a list of runs that meet those parameters.

It also allows a user to submit a new run, given they submit all the required fields under the right conditions.

The app uses Javascript, Node.js, Express Framework, MongoDB, and is hosted via Heroku. It can be found at:
