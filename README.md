run-generator
=============

The following is a web application I made for the Tufts University XC team that displays runs on campus.

It allows the user to input his starting location (one of two locations on campus), the preferred run distance, and his flexibility in miles, and it returns a list of runs that meets those parameters.

It also allows a user to submit a new run, given he submits all the required fields under the right conditions.

The app uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, AngularJS, Express.js, MongoDB, and is hosted via Heroku. It can be found at:
